# Plant_a_Seed

This is an app for taking care of your plants, not everyone has a green thumb, but would love to have many plants at  home for aesthetic purposes and we all know that plastic
plants are not good enough! This app allows people to capture the growth of their plants, be reminded whenever they need to be watered again and collect information about
the plants they own. I came up with this idea by having a plant craze that comes up every spring, I like to plant and take care of plants but sadly I do not have a green thumb
so this is something that would be very useful to me and for people who feel the same way about plants and their growth.
